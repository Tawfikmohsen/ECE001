    <td>1. Decisions taken by a machine are based on aset of algorithms:which reduces for error</td>
    <td>1. the overall cost of implementing an AL machine is huge; only a few can make use of it</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. the ability to take right decisions in a short span of time</td>
    <td>2. the dependency of humans on machines is ever increasing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. situations where the safety of a        human is unsure , an AL machine that is fitted with predefined algoriths can be used</td>
    <td>3. machines cannot think creatively or out of the box and will not perform such tasks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>4. since a machined does not get tired , it can work continuously without taking any breaks.</td>
    <td>4. with efficient and 24*7 AL and automation, human jobs will soon be replaced by machines in the future .</td>
